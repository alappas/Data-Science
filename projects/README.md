### Project Overview

You will be doing four unit projects and one final project in this class. Have a look at the [project timeline](./timeline.png) in this folder. Information about the projects will be announced in class and upploaded to here.

The final project should represent significant original work applying data science techniques to an interesting problem. Final projects are individual attainments, but you should be talking frequently with your instructor and classmates about them.

Address a data-related problem in your professional field or a field you're passionate about. If you have a strong interest in the subject matter, you'll create a better project and it will be a lot more fun for you!

Here's a collection of [past projects](https://gallery.generalassemb.ly/DS?metro=) from GA Data Science students that may help to stimulate your thinking. You're welcome to use [Github public datasets](https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets), [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) or private data, though with private data, you'll have to be careful about what you release. Competing in a [Kaggle competition](http://www.kaggle.com/) (including past competitions) is also a project option, in which case the data will be provided for you.
