This way no two variables are highly correlated and we can avoid multicollinearity altogether."

    "Answer: When beginning the exploratory analysis, we must first analyze the data so that we can make certain assumptions about the data and find out if it is normally distributed or not. Once that is done, we  know the way it is distributed and help factor that into the explanation of our results. Then we must determine if there are any outliers in the data and exclude them from the regression so as not to skew our data further. That way our data will be concise and more accurate. Additionally, we must avoid collinearity. We can test for collinearity by playing with the covariates/predictors in the regression and seeing if any major changes to the coefficients occur when doing so. If two variables are collinear, as can be the case when using dummy variables, we can exclude one of the variables to avoid collinearity. Finally, we are left with solid data that we can apply in a regression to find the desired results without any skewed or incomplete data."
