### Project Overview

The final project should represent significant original work applying data science techniques to an interesting problem. Final projects are individual attainments, but you should be talking frequently with your instructor and classmates about them.

Address a data-related problem in your professional field or a field you're passionate about. If you have a strong interest in the subject matter, you'll create a better project and it will be a lot more fun for you!

Here's a collection of [past projects](https://gallery.generalassemb.ly/DS?metro=) from GA Data Science students that may help to stimulate your thinking. You're welcome to use [Github public datasets](https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets), [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) or private data, though with private data, you'll have to be careful about what you release. Competing in a [Kaggle competition](http://www.kaggle.com/) (including past competitions) is also a project option, in which case the data will be provided for you.


## Development Environment

Start with your Windows or Mac Terminal app:

Type the following into your terminal...

```
conda create -n py27_ds_sm_15 python=2.7 anaconda conda install scikit-learn
conda install pandas
conda install seaborn
```
1. Run `source activate py27_ds_sm_15 `. This will activate an isolated environment for your Python 2.7 work. Different environments allow you to work with different versions of packages for Python 2 or Python 3. 
2. Run `jupyter notebook`
3. Kill Jupyter after you’re done by doing a `Ctrl-C` on the same window terminal you ran `jupyter notebook` from.
4. `source deactivate`
